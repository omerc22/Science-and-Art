\# FLAN T5 BASE CHATBOT



In this project, I implemented a simple chatbot using the Flan-T5 Base model from Hugging Face. The chatbot takes user input, processes it with a tokenizer, and generates a response using the model. 



WARNING

!!!The parameters are set to produce relevant and clear answers, although sometimes the model may repeat phrases or give less accurate responses.
