 FLAN T5 BASE CHATBOT



In this week I implemented a simple chatbot using the Flan-T5 Base model from Hugging Face. The chatbot takes user input, processes it with a tokenizer, and generates a response using the model. 



WARNING

!!!The parameters are set to produce relevant and clear answers but sometimes the model may repeat phrases or give less accurate responses.

Colab notebook is not showing up on github in a confusing way. I attached a photo for this:
